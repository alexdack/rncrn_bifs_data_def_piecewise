### Introduction 

This is the repository for the code and data associated with the pre-print "Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks that approximate arbitrary dynamics bifurcations, piecewise systems and data-defined limit cycles". The repository is structured by the examples presented in the paper, but has been designed to be easily modified for application of recurrent neural chemical reaction networks (RNCRNs) to new examples. 

### Data repository
Some data generated by this code was too large to store on GitHub. A Zenodo repository has been created to store these files: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18417715.
